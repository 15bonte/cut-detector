results:
- cur_log: good, could not find small point 17-25

- centered_log: good, could not find small point 17-25, find small FP frame 5
- mini_centered_log: like centered_log

- log2: misses frame 10 (too big); some FP; could not find small point 17-25
- log2_wider: good, some FP (expected because starts at 2); could not find small point 17-25

- mini_centered_log_0050/75/90: find a small point 21-22. Some FP. Ok otherwise


source: a_siLuci-1_mitosis_33_7_to_63.tiff (QUITE COMPLICATED)
(improvement on this source may come frome threshold/normalization, not sigma
probably a combination of both, + maybe a method where a threshold can be defined
per sigma)
results:
- cur_log: Sometimes Loses points, but find them later. Not perfect but working

- centered_log: Not much better than cur_log. More FP too
- mini_centered_log: Like centered

- log2: too small, some MB are not detected
- log2_wider: Like mini_centered_log

- mini_centered_log_00
50: LOTS of FP at beginning, maybe some additional midbodies are found. Bigger are losts
/75: 
/90: 



source: s1_siLuci-1_mitosis_14_158_to_227.tiff
results:
- cur_log: OK

- centered_log: Rougly like cur_log
- mini_centered_log: Same as centered

- log2_wider: more FP because starts at 2
- off_centered_log: For now, like centered


source: s2_siLuci-1_mitosis_15_67_to_228,211.tiff
results:
- cur_log: The real important points are detected, faded lost on 13, 16+

- centered_log: Detects additional point, lost 13-14 and 16+
- mini_centered_log: like centered_log

- log2_wider: 1-2 FP and lose 13-14 and 16+
- >off_centered_log<: like cur_log for the big, additional point detected


source: s3_siLuci-1_mitosis_17_170_to_195.tiff
Too much noise, only 2 frames of MB among 13.


source: s4_siLuci-1_mitosis_24_128_to_135.tiff
results:
- cur_log: MB lost frame 4, 7

- centered_log: 3 miss
- mini_centered_log: 3 miss

- log2_wider: FP, 2 miss inf,
- off_centered_log: 2 miss inf, 


source: s5_siLuci-1_mitosis_27_22_to_93,87.tiff
results:
- cur_log: Perfect

- centered_log: All MB + 1 FP (but OK not a pb)
- mini_centered_log: All MB + 1 FP (but OK not a pb)

- log2_wider: All MB + 1 FP (but OK not a pb)
- off_centered_log: All MB + 1 FP (but OK not a pb) 


source: s6_siLuci-1_mitosis_28_50_to_91.tiff
results:
- cur_log: Ok works
 
- centered_log: same results as cur_log
- mini_centered_log: same results as cur_log

- log2_wider: same results as cur_log + FP (not really interesting)
- off_centered_log: same results as cur_log


source: s7_siLuci-1_mitosis_31_19_to_73.tiff
results:
- cur_log: FP at beginning, MB found, OK
 
- centered_log: FP (more but OK) at beginning, MB found, OK
- mini_centered_log: same as centered_log

- log2_wider: more FP, then MB found
- off_centered_log: same as cur_log


source: s9_siLuci-1_mitosis_34_21_to_68,62.tiff
results:
- cur_log: MB found, no noise, OK
 
- centered_log: 1 FP at beginning, MB found, OK
- mini_centered_log: same as centered_log

- log2_wider: a little bit of noise at beginning (but OK), MB found, OK
- off_centered_log: a little bit of noise at beginning (but OK), MB found, OK


source: 20231019-t1_siCep55-50-4_mitosis_21_25_to_117.tiff
results:
- cur_log: no FP, finds nearly everything, middle and bottom points end up missing
 
- centered_log: like cur_log, middle and bottom are detected after going missing but
  too late for gap closing. Additional detections are only a couple of frames long
- mini_centered_log: same as centered_log

- >log2_wider<: did better than the other. Could detect middle and bottom longer,
  allowing gap closing to work
- off_centered_log: like centered_log



source: longcep1_20231019-t1_siCep55-50-1.tif
results:
Hard to compare, 
moreover all the MBs are competing to have the maximum values.
5 min runtime per test


CONCLUSION
Current Laplacian Of Gaussian works fine most of the time
(even though it starts at sigma=5 instead of being centered around)

Centered is really helping compared to cur_log.
It is completely OK to only test 3-5-7  (mini_centered_log)
No real differences spotted between those two.

log2_wider and off_centered_log can be interesting to add because:
- log2_wider: has a bigger area, some FP that could help
- off_centered_log: covers more values that cur_log, this extra area can
  sometimes be enough to gain a frame and then gap close.
