### API Assumption ###
These assumptions must be followed by both the API and the users
of the API.

The goal is to remove these assumptions at some point (by enabling
further configuration, but for now they are necessary):

'environment variables' (EV) here refer to the 'env' dict used
by the layers.

-- run_pipeline --
run_pipeline must fill the following env variables:
- "frame" with the current frame index, first is index 0.
  Additionnaly, it must be updated at every iteration
- "img" with the source image.
- "savers": array of instances of savers, that are used by the saving layers
- "source_fp": str of the source file, None if not provided

-- Blob Detectors: LapOfGauss, DiffOfGauss, DetOfHess --
They must fill the "blobs" EV

-- Environment: OnFrame and Image --
- OnFrame relies on "frame"
- SaveImage relies on "img"

(Note that SaveTime does not rely on "time", it is configured that way by default)
