## Installation

### Conda environment

It is highly recommended to create a dedicated conda environment, by following these few steps:

1. Install an [Anaconda] distribution of Python. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path.

2. Open an anaconda prompt and create a new environment with:

```
   conda create --name cut-detector python=3.9
```

3. Activate the newly created environment:

```
conda activate cut-detector
```

### Package installation

Once in a dedicated environment, our package can be installed via [pip]:

```
pip install cut_detector
```

### Fiji

This package relies on [Trackmate] to perform cell tracking. Trackmate is called through [Fiji], which has to be installed independently. Please follow the steps [here] to install it.

### GPU

We highly recommend to use GPU to speed up segmentation. To use your NVIDIA GPU, the first step is to download the dedicated driver from [NVIDIA].

Next we need to remove the CPU version of torch:

```
pip uninstall torch
```

The GPU version of torch to be installed can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). You may choose the CUDA version supported by your GPU, and install it with conda. This package has been developed with the version 11.6, installed with this command:

```
conda install numpy==1.25 pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

Note that we have added numpy here to prevent conda from installing a version higher than 1.25, which is not supported by numba.

If the previous results in an inifinite "Solving environment", consider using mamba instead of conda.
