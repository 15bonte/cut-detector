We are testing Current Laplacian Of Gaussian (cur_log).
"cur_log": (blob_log, {"min_sigma": 5, "max_sigma": 10, "num_sigma": 5, "threshold": 0.1}),

With Initial Spatial LapTrack Settings:
- weight_mklp_intensity_factor=5.0
- weight_sir_intensity_factor=1.50
- mid_body_linking_max_distance=100
- gap_closing_max_frame_count=3
- alternative_cost_percentile=100

Test 1: example_video_mitosis_0_0_to_4.tiff
* MB lost frame 40-41, found back on 42
* with only spatial tracking: same result
* with much bigger (x10) max distance: solves it.
   F39->40 (214,215)->(303,295) = 119.67
   F40->41 (303,295)->(373,162) = 150.3
>> mid_body_linking_max_distance to 175 <<

Test 2: s1_siLuci-1_mitosis_14_158_to_227.tiff
* Green jumps between F10-11
* with only spatial tracking: same results
@ Issue here is that detection lost most points
* distance: (277,63)->(323,193) = 134
* intensity: origine [174]->156; dest 150->[173]
@ MKLP Intensity of target is nearly the same as the one from source.
  Should we question the hypothesis of conservation of intensities ?
>> No change. To improve, we will need a better detection <<
(if we have a better detection, we have keep the point longer and can
decrease the weight given to intensity, preventing the jump)
? What if we used SIR Tubilin ?
* Trying to disable MKLP: no results
* intensity: SIR origine [166]->173; dest 328->[390];
* Experimentation: disable MKLP AND distance, only keep SIR: no results
* increase a lot SIR weigth (x10): no results
>> No Change for now. Another way to improve may be to change Spatial Laptrack
and add a kind of composite cost cutoff OR a cutoff per parameter ? <<


Test 3: s2_siLuci-1_mitosis_15_67_to_228,211.tiff
* Everything works as expected. Detection not perfect but should be enough 
>> No Change <<


Test 4: s3_siLuci-1_mitosis_17_170_to_195.tiff
* Everything works as expected. Some detection FP but there are OK 
>> No Change <<


Test 5: s4_siLuci-1_mitosis_24_128_to_135.tiff
* Works as expected 
>> No Change <<


Test 6: s5_siLuci-1_mitosis_27_22_to_93,87.tiff
* Works as expected 
>> No Change <<


Test 7: s6_siLuci-1_mitosis_28_50_to_91.tiff
* MB jumps between F5-6
* with only spatial tracking: no results
* lowering alternative percentile drastically: no effect...


==========
alternative_cost_percentile does nothing on Spatial LapTrack, while 
it does somethoing on LapTrack:
it allows new points to be created if the distance would be too high
(higher than alternative_cost_percentile of the distribution)

It seams that there is a bug somewhere in Spatial LapTrack that prevents
it from working
