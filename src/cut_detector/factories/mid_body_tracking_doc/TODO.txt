Things to do for tracking
- [ ] Implement the binding to obtain MidBodyTrack from LapTrack
- [X] Understand why some images don't work (*)
- [ ] Add other features to LapTrack (such as MLPK and SIR channels values)
- [ ] Performance metrics 


(*) For now, when a frame does not contain a midbody, no line is added to the
dataframe.
Maybe instead a line should be added, but with no other values ?
