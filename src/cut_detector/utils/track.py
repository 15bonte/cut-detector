"""Track is the common ancestor for all specialized tracks of Specialized Points.

To create a new specialized track, you must do the following:
- Create your specialized XYZSpot class:
    - Make it inherit from Spot
    - implement (static function) Spot.get_extra_features_name()
    - implement (method) Spot.get_extra_features()
    (see their doc for additional help)
    
- Create your specialized XYZTrack class:
    - Make it inherit from Track
    - implement (static function) Track.track_df_to_track_list()

- In gen_track.py:
    - import your new specialized track,
    - import your new specialized spot,
    - add them to the SPOT_AND_TRACK_MAPPING dict,
